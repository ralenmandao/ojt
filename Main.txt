AddAdmin, AddressBook, AdminUserControl, GiftAdd
Have all the same code, the only changes is their records queries,
so i will try to explain AddAdmin so that you will understand the others

So i will simulate it for you

(FORM LOAD)
>> hideSecondaryButtons()
The form was open so we dont want to show the Save, Cancel, Clear since i didnt press New or Update button
>> showMainButtons()
Now i want the user to show New, Update and Delete
>> disableFields()
But i dont want the user to edit the textboxes unless the user click New, or Update
>> reloadAdmins()
Now i want the table to laod the latest records in my database

(WHEN THE USER SELECT A ROW)
>> If dgvAdmins.SelectedRows.Count > 0
I want to change the textboxes values when the user change selection , but the problem when for example
there is only 1 row left and you deleted it then dgvUser_SelectionChanged() will still be called , since
the selection is change to nothing, so we need to make sure that whenever dgvUser_SelectionChanged() is called
there is a selected values
>> Dim id As Integer = dgvAdmins.SelectedRows(0).Cells(0).Value
>> ...
now i will save each selected rows values to each variable so that i can easily locate them istead of using 
dgvAdmins.SelectedRows(0).Cells(0).Value everytime i want to select an id , then display each on their respective
textboxes

(WHEN THE USER CLICK NEW)
>> clear()
since we change each textboxes value whenever we select a row , we need to clear each textboxes when the user type
>> saveMode = "new"
we only have 1 save button , so that save button will save whenever we create New, or Update , the problem was
if the save button was click how it will know if im creating or updating a record ? , thats why we change saveMode
each time New or Update was click, so that save will decide if it will Insert the record or Update the record
